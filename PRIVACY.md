# Privacy Policy

Thank you for using our **163 SMTP Email Sender** plugin. We take your privacy very seriously. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data when using this plugin, with a focus on transparency and security.

## 1. Data Collection

### What Data Do We Collect?
- **Email Account Information**: To send emails, you need to provide your 163 email login credentials (username and password). These credentials are used solely for authenticating with the 163 SMTP server during the email-sending process.
- **Email Content**: The subject, body, and attachments of the emails you input into the plugin. This data is only used to send emails via the 163 SMTP service.
- **Usage Data**: The plugin may temporarily record non-personalized usage data, such as the number of emails sent and timestamps, to improve functionality. This data is not stored or shared.

### What Data Do We NOT Collect?
- We do not collect, store, or retain any of your personal information, including your email credentials or email content.
- We do not collect your browsing history, device information, or any other data unrelated to sending emails.

## 2. Data Storage

### How We Handle Data
- **No Data Storage**: Your email credentials and email content are **not stored** on our servers or devices. All data is used only during the email-sending process and is immediately discarded afterward.
